  "description": "The Gae Aulenti Piazza is a stylish and beautiful space with sculptural features including a continuous flowing circle of seating surrounding a vast reflecting pool, 60 metres in diameter that reflects the colours of the changing seasons and surrounding buildings. The pool cascades down two floors, the sound of which mitigates the noise pollution of surrounding roads, and creating three beautiful oval cascades that bring daylight and natural ventilation to spaces below. The light wells that it creates connect the square with the retail floor and car parking below, whilst also allowing light and air to penetrate the surrounding towersâ€™ deep footprints."
